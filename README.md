- **INTRODUCTION**
      
**Write and find the notes very fast.**

MyNotes allows you to easily and quickly start writing as many notes as you want.
Thanks to its view as a gallery, you can see all your notes in thumbnails, so it will be very easy for you to find just the note you are looking for.


**Write the notes wherever you go.**

Open MyNotes from any device and enjoy the comfort of writing notes from your computer, mobile or tablet.


- **RUN SERVER**

The first thing you have to do to be able to use the notes application is to run the ruby on rails server. For this, you will have to open the project from an integrated development environment, such as Visual Studio and open a New Terminal.

After that, type in the terminal the command ‘rails server’ and click enter.

When the execution of ruby on rails server begins, an underlined IP address will appear, like the one in the following image.

You should click on this IP address, and it will take you directly to the notes application.
